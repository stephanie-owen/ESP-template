This folder contains templates to create a two-page Ecosystem and Socioeconomic Profile report card.

`report_card_template.qmd` can be edited to produce the first page of the report card. `template.tex` is a necessary helper file, which can be updated if desired. 

`table_template.csv` should  be updated with relevant indicator information, including file paths to figures. 

Backgrounds for page 1 and 2 of the report card must be added in Adobe Acrobat, as bugs in the code prevent the backgrounds from loading directly into the PDF from the qmd file. 
To add backgrounds:
 1. Separate pages by Edit -> Organize pages -> Right click on page 2 -> Extract pages (This should open up a new tab with just page 2)
 2. Click the trash can icon to remove page 2
 3. Add page 1 background: In the same 'Edit' tab, select 'More' -> Background -> Add. A pop-up box will appear.
        - Select 'File' and 'Browse' for `bg_pg1.jpg` in the 'docs' folder
 4. Repeat step 3 for page 2, attaching `bg_pg2.jpg` as the background
 5. Combine pages 1 and 2 with backgrounds: Edit -> Organize pages -> Insert -> From File -> (Insert file of page 2 with background)
